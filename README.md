## How to run the website 

In the the Backend directory, open a console tab and type:

### `node server.js`

Then go to the Frontend directory, open a new console tab and type:

### `npm start`

The development server will start and you should be redirected to a new browser tab showing the website

If you are not redirected then you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
